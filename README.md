# Swift - Missing Docs

As a Swift developer, it can be frustrating to stumble into an area of the language, the standard
library, or the core frameworks that less than completely documented. Swift is a moving target,
which aims to support many operating systems and platforms, and continues to contain warts from
previous history. Despite these challenges, the language and ecosystem continue to make progress as
long as we identify shortcomings and make an effort to address them.

This project is my personal notebook of info I wish I found in other documentation. The goal is to
supplement other documentation so that my future self, and hopefully other developers, have a
place to find info that wasn't easy to figure out the first time.

## Table of contents

* [Foundation](Foundation.md)
* [DocC Papercuts](DocC-Papercuts.md)

## Contributions

I'm happy to take suggestions and contributions. If there's something you also wished you found in
the documentation, feel free to open an issue, PR, or a discussion.
